        <h2>Analysis of the First and Second Tables in the Context of Women's Rights</h2>
        <p>The two tables visually represent the historical trends of male and female participation in the workplace. These trends highlight the evolution of gender roles, labor market dynamics, and the progress of women's rights over time.</p>

        <!-- First Table: Literacy Rate in Azerbaijan -->
        <h3>First Table: Literacy Rate in Azerbaijan (1841 - 2025)</h3>
        <p>This table shows the literacy rate of men and women in Azerbaijan from 1841 to 2025.</p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Year</th>
                <th>Men's Literacy Rate</th>
                <th>Women's Literacy Rate</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>

                <td>10-15%</td>
                <td>1-3%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

        </table>

        <p><strong>Relevance to Women's Rights:</strong> Education is a key driver of women's empowerment. The dramatic increase in female literacy has allowed women to access better job opportunities, challenge traditional gender roles, and participate more actively in the workforce and society.</p>

        <!-- Second Table: Average Hours of Work per Week by Gender -->
        <h3>Second Table: Average Hours of Work per Week by Gender (1900 - 2023, United States)</h3>
        <p>This table presents the working hours of men and women over time, divided into total work, market work (paid employment), and home production (unpaid labor like housework and childcare).</p>

        <table>
            <tr>

            </tr>
        </table>

        <p><strong>Relevance to Women's Rights:</strong> This data illustrates the fight for gender equality in the workplace. Over the past century, women have gained more access to paid jobs, better labor rights, and shared responsibilities in household duties. However, the data also suggests that women still perform more unpaid labor than men, highlighting the ongoing struggle for full gender equality in both professional and domestic spheres.</p>

        <!-- Overall Interpretation -->
        <h3>Overall Interpretation</h3>
        <p>Both tables showcase the historical progress of women's rights in education and the labor market. Increased literacy rates allowed women to enter the workforce, and over time, societal attitudes toward gender roles shifted. However, challenges remain, as women still bear a larger share of unpaid labor.</p>

        <p>These trends highlight the importance of continuing efforts toward workplace equality, fair wages, and better policies to support work-life balance for both men and women.</p>
